#Welcome

This repository consists of some solutions to challenges proposed in popular site Hacker Rank. The repo is organized
by uncategorized challenges and contests' challenges. Each folder contains the challenge instructions, solution code 
and respective tests.

Feel free to clone this repository, discuss or propose other solution (in this case I suggest forking the repo) or even 
make a pull request if you find missing tests or the solution is wrong.
