#Day 25: Running Time and Complexity!

In this challenge, you will determine if a given number X is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. You will be given N numbers and for each, you will print out "Prime" if the number is prime or "Not prime" if the number is not prime.

If this is too easy, create a method that decides if X is prime or not in O(âˆšX) time. Think modulos and square root! If you are having trouble, try creating an O(X) time algorithm and see whether it solves the problem or not.

To review Big-O Notation, remember...

* Big-O "is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm."
* Big-O "specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm."

**Input Format**

The first line of the input is **T**, total number of test cases. Each of the next line contains an integer **N**.

**Constraints**

* **1 <= T <= 20**
* **1 <= N <= 2 x 109**
